# Dexter App

This is a simple application built with Next.js 14 App Router, leveraging server-side rendering (SSR) to provide a performant user experience.

## Features

- **Integration of Charts**: The app integrates charts using the Recharts library to visualize data effectively.
- **Paginated Table**: Utilizes the @tanstack query library to implement a paginated table, enhancing data presentation and navigation.
- **Shadcn Library**: Includes the Shadcn library for styling components and enhancing the UI.
- **Implementation of Incomplete Registered Users Filter**: Implements a filter to display incomplete registered users.

## Note

While the app currently handles filtering of incomplete registered users on the frontend, it's worth noting that exposing a filter query via the API would be a more efficient approach. By doing so, filtering could be handled on the backend, reducing the amount of data transferred and improving overall performance.
